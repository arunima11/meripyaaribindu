Heartbroken Bindu blames her father as he was driving the car while drunk. Her growing resentment towards her father forces her to leave college and go to Melbourne. Meanwhile, Abhimanyu graduates from his college and goes to Bangalore to study Master of Business Administration. After a few years, Abhi goes to Goa, where he meets Bindu. Bindu tells him that she is engaged. Heartbroken Abhimanyu now goes to Mumbai and starts working in a bank. Bindu calls him to a restaurant and tells him that she did not marry that man as he fled. Abhimanyu tries to reconcile their friendship and goes out of his way to tend to Bindu's needs. He even leaves his girlfriend.
